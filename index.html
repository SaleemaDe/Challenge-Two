            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Saleema, I am 24 living in Toronto my whole life. I am a beginner in the VFX industry, and
                continuing my education; after graduating from Toronto Film School with a diploma in Visual Effects for
                TV & Film.
                I decided to further continue my education in this field while looking for work to help improve my
                skills as well as learn new ones.
                I never knew what I wanted to do, after changing careers 5 times, I finally realized the love I have for
                art, the overall effects and amount of work it takes to bring a scene or shot together within a film or
                episode.
                In my free time I like to take photos, play sports, and just hangout with friends going to places we
                never been.
